# sharing-fest
android application to share notes between laptop and android mobile device.  


* All the branches must be cut from dev.
* No one should ever commit directly into main or dev branch.  
* pull request must be made to master or dev to merge the code into the main or dev branch


Project will include  
1. A web application - node.js
2. An android application.

We will create a socket between the web app and the android client. This socket will stream data to each of the endpoints.
